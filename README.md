# Routecraft: A Garbage Truck Route Optimization System

Routecraft is a sophisticated solution designed to optimize the routes of garbage trucks, ensuring efficient waste collection with minimal fuel consumption and operational costs. Leveraging advanced algorithms and geospatial data, Routecraft generates the most effective routes for garbage trucks.

## Features

- **Route Optimization**: Generates optimal routes for garbage trucks based on various parameters such as distance, traffic conditions, and waste collection points.
- **Priority Based Algorithm** - Usage of A* search algorithm and shortest path algorithms to create a priority-based system that takes into consideration all the above mentioned factors to give optimized route.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Utilizes geospatial data to plan and adjust routes dynamically.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for inputting data and viewing optimized routes.
- **Real-Time Adjustments**: Allows for real-time route adjustments based on live traffic updates and other factors.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Aims to reduce operational costs and fuel consumption.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SharanyaR1/Final-Year-Project
   cd Final-Year-Project

   Create a virtual environment:

2. Install the required packages:

Run the application:
After installing the dependencies, you can run the application using the following command:

      ```sh
      Copy code
      python app.py
      This will start the system and you can begin interacting with the interface.

##Usage
Input Data: Provide the necessary data such as waste collection points, truck capacities, and other relevant parameters.
Generate Routes: Use the interface to generate optimized routes for the garbage trucks.
View Routes: Visualize the optimized routes on the map.
Adjust Routes: Make real-time adjustments to routes based on current conditions.
